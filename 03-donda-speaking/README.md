## Donda

Finishing up the `donda-speaking` project. Major things I worked on include:

i. Fixing the issue with `parcel` by updating `parcel`
ii. Figuring out to bundle multiple html files at the same time with `parcel`
iii. Creating scripts to bundle the files in `development` and `production`
iv. Deploying to Netlify
v. Adding the domain of the deployed version to authorized domains in firebase.
